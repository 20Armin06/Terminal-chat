# 🖥️ Terminal Chat App using Python Sockets

A simple command-line chat application built with Python.  
It uses sockets to send and receive messages over a network port.

## 🔌 How It Works

The app has two parts:

- **Server**: Listens for incoming connections on a specified port
- **Client**: Connects to the server and sends messages

Communication is done via TCP sockets.

## 📦 Features

- Real-time message exchange between server and client
- Works on local network (LAN) or same machine (localhost)
- Terminal-based, lightweight and simple
- Single or multi-client version (depending on your implementation)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- `socket` module (built-in)
